# Privacy Policy for Flowt

*Last Updated: July 30, 2025*

Thank you for using Flowt. This privacy policy explains what information the extension collects, how it's used, and why certain permissions are required. Your privacy is our top priority.

The core principle of Flowt is to be a private and secure tool. The extension **does not collect, store, or transmit** any of your personal information or Browse history.

## Information We Use

- **Extension Settings:** We save your configuration choices (e.g., whether you've toggled "Hide Feed" or "Hide Comments"). This data is anonymous and is stored locally in your browser to ensure the extension works as you've configured it.

- **Personal Information:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or Browse activity.

## Data Storage and Security

All your Flowt settings are stored using Chrome's built-in `storage.sync` service. This means your settings are saved securely in your browser and synced to your personal Google account. This data is never sent to or stored on our servers.

## Permissions Explained

Flowt requests a few permissions to function correctly. Hereâ€™s why each one is needed:

- **`storage`**: Required to save your toggle settings (e.g., "Hide Feed") in the browser.

- **`declarativeNetRequest`**: Used exclusively for the "Permanently Block" Shorts feature. It allows the extension to block navigation to YouTube Shorts URLs at the network level without reading your Browse activity.

- **`tabs`**: Used for a single purpose: to find and close any currently open Shorts tabs immediately after you enable the "Permanently Block" feature. The extension does not monitor or store your tab information otherwise.

## Third-Party Services

**Feature Requests & Support:** The extension provides optional links to a Google Form for feature requests and a `mailto:` link for support. If you choose to use these, the information you submit is governed by the respective privacy policies of Google or your email provider. No information is shared through these links automatically.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We encourage you to review it periodically.
